-viewing data -
SELECT * FROM spotify2023

-quick cleaning column names -
ALTER TABLE spotify2023 RENAME COLUMN artist(s)_name TO artists_name;

-identified interest points in table, looking to find top streamed songs -
SELECT track_name, artist_count, released_year, streams, danceability_, bpm, key  FROM spotify2023
ORDER BY streams DESC;

-creating a new column to categorize 'danceability' data-
ALTER TABLE spotify2023
ADD COLUMN dance_level VARCHAR(20);

-updating new column with ranking of dance level-
UPDATE spotify2023
SET dance_level =
    CASE
        WHEN danceability_ < 25 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN danceability_ < 50 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN danceability_ < 75 THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Extra High'
    END;

-double checking of course!-

select track_name, danceability_, dance_level from spotify2023
ORDER BY danceability_ DESC;

-lets make another column to categorize music speed based on bpm-
ALTER TABLE spotify2023
ADD COLUMN music_speed VARCHAR(20);

-updating new column with ranking of dance level speed-
UPDATE spotify2023
SET music_speed =
    CASE
        WHEN bpm < 70 THEN 'Slow'
        WHEN bpm < 90 THEN 'Medium Slow'
        WHEN bpm < 110 THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN bpm < 130 THEN 'Medium Fast'
        ELSE 'Fast'
    END;

-lets double check again-
SELECT track_name, bpm, music_speed FROM spotify2023
ORDER BY bpm DESC;

-next lets create a field to simplify current releases and past releases-

-final edit! making a column to categorize collaborative songs-
ALTER TABLE spotify2023
ADD COLUMN collab VARCHAR;

-lets set some conditions for this new column-
UPDATE spotify2023
SET collab =
    CASE
        WHEN artist_count > 1 THEN 'Collab'
        ELSE 'Solo'
    END;

-final check-
SELECT track_name, artist_count, collab FROM spotify2023;

-now lets do some analysis! finding general info on the top 20 most streamed songs-
SELECT track_name, artists_name, artist_count, music_speed, dance_level, streams, collab FROm spotify2023
ORDER BY streams DESC
LIMit 20;

-i'd like to better understand the top 20 performing solo artists by total # of streams of 2023-
SELECT artist_name, SUM(streams) AS total_streams
FROM your_table_name
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY total_streams DESC, artist_name
LIMIT 20;
